The file named "Potential Security Event Handling Guide.pdf" was created speicifcally for an organization that didn't want to make security difficult but wanted to improve upon existing methods. I identified a need for standardization of escalations between the engineering, service desk, and newly created security team. I tailored the guide to the organization's leadership and staff while still utilizing necessary principles from NIST SP 800-61. https://github.com/ticfinack/Showcase/blob/main/Policies%20and%20Procedures/Potential%20Security%20Event%20Handling%20Guide.pdf
