The file above named "mailServerDeployment.yaml" is a K8s deployment yaml that creates microservices supporting a complete cloud mail server and storage solution. This application is capable of authenticating xoauth2 IMAP and SMTP when combined with an IDP such as Keycloak. This is one of many containerized applications that I have developed and run on kubernetes clusters.
